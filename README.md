# Agricultural Production Prediction Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting agricultural production using machine learning models. The goal is to provide farmers and agricultural stakeholders with insights into expected crop yields based on various meteorological factors. The project addresses the need for accurate agricultural production forecasting to optimize resources, reduce waste, and enhance decision-making processes in the agricultural sector.

## Methodology and Processes

### General Workflow

The project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathering and cleaning meteorological and agricultural data.
2. **Model Selection and Training**: Implementing and fine-tuning machine learning models.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Validating model performance using metrics like RMSE.
4. **Web Application Development**: Creating an interactive interface for users to input data and receive predictions.
5. **Deployment**: Deploying the application to the cloud for accessibility.

### Data Explanation

- **Sources**: Meteorological data (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and agricultural yield data.
- **Cleaning and Processing**: Handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Machine Learning Models

- **CatBoost and LightGBM**: Selected for their performance with tabular data and ability to handle categorical variables.
- **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

### Validation and Performance Evaluation

- **Cross-Validation**: To ensure robustness, cross-validation was performed, and RMSE was calculated to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Identifying the most impactful variables on agricultural yield predictions.

## Web Application Development
